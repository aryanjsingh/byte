=== Email Account Hacked ===
First 15 Minutes:
1. Change Password immediately from a different device if possible.
2. Sign out of all other sessions (Gmail: Details > Sign out all other web sessions).
3. Check and remove any unknown Recovery Email or Phone Number.
4. Check "Filters" and "Forwarding" settings – hackers often forward your mail to themselves.
24 Hours:
1. Enable 2FA / MFA.
2. Alert your contacts (social media/WhatsApp) that your email was hacked so they ignore scams coming from you.
3. Check services linked to that email (Bank, Social Media) for unauthorized access.

=== Malware / Ransomware Infection ===
First 15 Minutes:
1. Disconnect from the Internet (Unplug Ethernet, Turn off Wi-Fi) immediately to prevent spread.
2. Do NOT pay the ransom. It does not guarantee data recovery and funds future attacks.
3. Backup critical files if possible (only if you sure they aren't infected, otherwise skip).
24 Hours:
1. Boot into "Safe Mode".
2. Run a full scan using a reputable Antivirus (Malwarebytes, Bitdefender, etc.).
3. If deep infection, consider completely wiping the drive and reinstalling the OS.

=== Data Breach Suspicion ===
Signs:
- You receive an alert from distinct services, or find your data on HaveIBeenPwned.
Actions:
1. Identify exactly which password was leaked.
2. Change that password and ANY other account where you reused it.
3. Enable 2FA on critical accounts (Banking, Email).
4. Monitor bank statements for unusual transactions.
