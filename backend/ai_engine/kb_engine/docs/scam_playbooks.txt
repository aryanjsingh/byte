2. Decline the request.
3. Block and report the number on the app.

=== Fake KYC / Bank Freeze ===

- Received from personal mobile number instead of official sender ID (e.g., +91-9876... instead of AD-SBI).
Immediate Actions:
1. Do not click the link.
2. Call your bank using the number on your debit card (NOT the number in the SMS).

=== Fake Courier / FedEx Scam ===
Description: Automated call saying "Illegal package confiscated in your name containing drugs/passports."
Signs:

2. Exit the group and block contacts. 
3. Remember: Legitimate jobs never ask you to pay to work.

- Or asks for a screenshot of a URL sent to your SMS/Email (which is actually a Password Reset link).
Immediate Actions:
1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication (2FA) immediately.
2. Do not click links from friends asking for strange favors without calling them first.
