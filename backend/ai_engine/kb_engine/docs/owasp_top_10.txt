METADATA
Topic: OWASP Top 10
Type: Framework
Difficulty: Intermediate

CONTENT
1. Broken Access Control
Description: Users can act outside of their intended permissions.
Example: A user changes the URL from /user/get?id=123 to /user/get?id=456 and views another user's data.
Fix: Implement proper server-side access control checks for every request.

2. Cryptographic Failures
Description: Sensitive data (passwords, health records) is stored or transmitted without proper encryption.
Example: Storing passwords in plain text or using weak hashing algorithms like MD5.
Fix: Use strong algorithms (Argon2, bcrypt), enforce HTTPS options (HSTS).

3. Injection
Description: Untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query.
Example: SQL Injection where input ' OR 1=1 -- is used to bypass login.
Fix: Use parameterized queries/prepared statements; validate all inputs.

4. Insecure Design
Description: Risks related to design flaws and architectural structures.
Example: An e-commerce site designed without bot protection allows unlimited coupon code guessing.
Fix: Integrate threat modeling into the design phase.

5. Security Misconfiguration
Description: Default configurations, incomplete setups, or open cloud storage.
Example: An AWS S3 bucket left open to the public containing sensitive backups.
Fix: Automate verification of configuration effectiveness; remove default accounts.

6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components
Description: Using libraries or frameworks with known vulnerabilities.
Example: Using an old version of Log4j.
Fix: Regularly scan dependencies (using tools like Snyk or OWASP Dependency Check) and patch.

7. Identification and Authentication Failures
Description: Weaknesses in session management or credential handling.
Example: Allowing weak passwords like "password123" or not implementing rate limiting on login.
Fix: Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and strong password policies.

8. Software and Data Integrity Failures
Description: Code and infrastructure that does not protect against integrity violations.
Example: Updates downloaded without signing verification.
Fix: Use digital signatures to verify software updates.

9. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
Description: Failures to log critical events or monitor for malicious activity.
Example: Login failures are not logged, allowing an attacker to brute-force accounts unnoticed.
Fix: Log all login, access control, and server-side input validation failures.

10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
Description: Applications fetching a remote resource without validating the user-supplied URL.
Example: An attacker forces the server to connect to internal services like metadata APIs.
Fix: Validate and sanitize all user-supplied URLs; blacklist internal IP ranges.
