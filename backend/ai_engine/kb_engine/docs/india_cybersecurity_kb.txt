# CYBERSECURITY AWARENESS & THREAT EDUCATION (INDIA)

Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting systems, networks, applications, and users from digital attacks aimed at stealing data, extorting money, or disrupting services.

## Common Cyber Threats in India

### Phishing
Phishing is a fraud technique where attackers impersonate trusted entities to steal sensitive data like passwords, OTPs, or bank details.

Red Flags:
- Urgency (account blocked, action required)
- Unknown or misspelled sender domains
- Shortened or suspicious URLs
- Grammar or formatting errors

Examples in India:
- Fake bank SMS requesting KYC update
- Fake government emails (Income Tax, Aadhaar)
- Fake delivery messages (Amazon, Flipkart)
- Fake UPI payment requests

### Malware
Malware is malicious software designed to damage or spy on devices.

Types:
- Virus: Self-replicating malicious code
- Trojan: Disguised as legitimate software
- Spyware: Monitors user activity secretly
- Ransomware: Encrypts files and demands payment

Symptoms:
- Slow system performance
- Unknown apps appearing
- High data usage
- Frequent pop-ups
- Battery draining quickly

### Social Engineering
Psychological manipulation to trick users into revealing confidential information.

Common Examples in India:
- Fake job offers on WhatsApp
- Lottery/prize scams
- Impersonation calls (bank officials, police)
- Fake customer support calls
- Romance scams on dating apps

### UPI & Payment Frauds (India-Specific)
- Fake "collect request" scams on PhonePe, GPay, Paytm
- QR code frauds (scanning malicious QR codes)
- Screen sharing scams (AnyDesk, TeamViewer)
- Refund frauds (fake refund links)
- Fake UPI apps

## Cyber Hygiene Best Practices
- Use strong and unique passwords (12+ characters)
- Enable multi-factor authentication (2FA)
- Never share OTPs with anyone
- Verify links before clicking
- Keep devices and apps updated
- Use official app stores only
- Avoid public WiFi for banking
- Regularly check bank statements

# PHISHING, SCAM & FRAUD DETECTION

## Common Phishing Keywords
- Urgent action required
- Verify immediately
- Account suspended
- Refund pending
- Limited time offer
- KYC update required
- Your account will be blocked

## Domain Spoofing Indicators
- Character substitution (l → I, o → 0)
- Extra words (secure-bank-login.com)
- Uncommon TLDs (.xyz, .top, .click)

Examples:
- Fake: bankoflndia.in (uses lowercase L instead of I)
- Real: bankofindia.in
- Fake: sbi-secure-login.com
- Real: onlinesbi.com

## Malicious URL Indicators
- URL shorteners (bit.ly, tinyurl)
- IP-based URLs (http://192.168.x.x)
- Excessive query parameters
- Misspelled brand names
- HTTP instead of HTTPS

## Dangerous Attachment Types
- .exe (executable)
- .js (JavaScript)
- .zip/.rar (compressed, may hide malware)
- .html (can contain scripts)
- .xlsm/.docm (macro-enabled Office files)

## Scam Categories in India
- Job fraud (fake hiring, advance fees)
- Investment scams (crypto, forex, MLM)
- Romance scams (dating apps, social media)
- Fake loan apps (predatory lending)
- Government scheme scams (PM Kisan, Ayushman)
- Tech support scams (Microsoft, antivirus)
- Electricity bill scams (disconnection threats)

# INCIDENT RESPONSE & RECOVERY

## Incident Response Lifecycle (NIST-Based)
1. Preparation: Have plans and tools ready
2. Identification: Detect and confirm the incident
3. Containment: Limit the damage
4. Eradication: Remove the threat
5. Recovery: Restore normal operations
6. Lessons Learned: Document and improve

## Incident Playbooks

### Ransomware Infection
1. Disconnect from network immediately
2. Isolate infected system
3. Do NOT pay the ransom
4. Restore from clean backup
5. Report to CERT-In
6. Change all passwords

### Account Compromise
1. Reset password immediately
2. Enable MFA/2FA
3. Review login history
4. Check for unauthorized transactions
5. Notify bank or platform
6. Report to cybercrime portal

### Data Breach
1. Identify exposed data
2. Inform affected users
3. Secure systems
4. Legal reporting if required
5. Monitor for misuse

### UPI Fraud Recovery
1. Report to bank within 3 days
2. File complaint on cybercrime.gov.in
3. Call 1930 helpline
4. Block UPI ID if compromised
5. Keep transaction screenshots

# SECURE CODING & DEVELOPER SECURITY

## Insecure Coding Practices

Hardcoded credentials (NEVER DO THIS):
password = "admin123"
api_key = "sk-xxxxx"

Use of eval() (DANGEROUS):
eval(user_input)

SQL Injection vulnerability:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '" + user_id + "'

## Secure Coding Best Practices
- Use parameterized queries for database
- Store secrets in environment variables
- Validate and sanitize all user input
- Implement proper authentication & authorization
- Log security events
- Use HTTPS everywhere
- Keep dependencies updated
- Follow OWASP guidelines

## OWASP Top 10 Risks (2021)
1. Broken Access Control
2. Cryptographic Failures
3. Injection (SQL, XSS, etc.)
4. Insecure Design
5. Security Misconfiguration
6. Vulnerable Components
7. Authentication Failures
8. Software Integrity Failures
9. Logging & Monitoring Failures
10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
